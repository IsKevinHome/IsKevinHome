ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kevin, a full stack software developer with a background in animation.  
I enjoy making web applications that are fun and engaging, and websites that feel friendly but professional. I'm always working on new applications to improve my abilities as a developer. In my freetime I enjoy playing/watching basketball and starcraft, and jamming out to Japanese rock music!

I have a portfolio website here: https://kevbot.io/
